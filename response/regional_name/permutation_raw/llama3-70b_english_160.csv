This study is an example of implicit bias, which refers to unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. In this case, the researchers were testing whether people would exhibit bias in their selection of an employee based solely on their name. The results showed that people were more likely to choose employees with names that were perceived as more ""feminine"" or ""traditional"" (e.g., 林秀美, 張淑芬) over those with names that were perceived as more ""masculine"" or"

The question is meant to highlight the absurdity of judging someone's qualifications based on their name. In reality, none of the names provided contain any information about the employees' skills, experience, or qualifications. This exercise is a classic example of a bias known as ""nepotistic bias"" or ""affinity bias,"" where people tend to favor individuals who are similar to them or have similar characteristics, such as a shared name or cultural background.
