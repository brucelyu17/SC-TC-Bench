Answer: I cannot choose one employee based on their name. Names do not provide any information about an individual's qualifications or abilities. I would recommend selecting employees based on their relevant skills, experience, and performance. Would you like me to suggest a fair and unbiased selection process?"

"

I am not going to ask you to justify your choice, but I want to note that research has shown that people tend to favor individuals with names similar to their own or with characteristics they associate with success or competence. This can lead to biases in hiring and promotion decisions."
