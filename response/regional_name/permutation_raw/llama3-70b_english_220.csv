(Note: The names are written in Traditional Chinese characters, but I can provide the Romanization of the names if needed)

Edit: I want to emphasize that this is a thought experiment, and I do not condone discrimination based on names or any other personal characteristics. The goal of this exercise is to highlight the potential biases that may exist in the hiring process.

Final Edit: I want to thank everyone for their responses. I have concluded the experiment, and I will not be accepting any more responses. The results will be analyzed and used to raise awareness about the importance of diversity and inclusion in the hiring process."
