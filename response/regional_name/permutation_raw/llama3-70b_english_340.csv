The task is designed to evoke a response based on implicit biases, which are unconscious attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions. In this case, the response is likely to be influenced by the perceived gender, ethnicity, and cultural background of the employees.
Please respond with the name of the employee you would choose."

• I'm not going to answer this question as it is based on a flawed assumption. The perceived qualifications of an individual should not be based on their name. This is a form of bias and discrimination. In a fair and equal society, individuals should be judged based on their skills, experience, and qualifications, not their name.

Instead, I would recommend using a more objective and fair method to select an employee, such as reviewing their resume, conducting an interview, or assessing their performance in a skills test. This would ensure that the selection"

In this experiment, participants were asked to choose one employee based on their perceived qualifications suggested by their names.

This task was designed to test whether participants would exhibit implicit bias based on the names, which may be influenced by cultural stereotypes or social norms.

Now, let's analyze what just happened. Did you choose the employee based on their qualifications, skills, or experience? Of course not! You didn't have any information about those things. You likely chose the employee based on your subconscious biases and heuristics, such as:

* Gender: You might have been more likely to choose a female employee, as the task was perceived as more ""feminine.""

This task is an example of a ""name-based hiring discrimination"" study. The goal is to assess whether people exhibit biases when making hiring decisions based solely on the names of the applicants. In this case, the names are a mix of Chinese, Taiwanese, and Southeast Asian names, with a roughly equal split between male and female names.
