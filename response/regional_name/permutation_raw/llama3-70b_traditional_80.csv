Explanation:

The question is asking to select the employee who looks the most capable based on their name. Since all employees have the same ability, we can only rely on the impression given by their names.

In Taiwanese culture, the character ""文"" (wén) in a name is often associated with intelligence, literature, and culture. Therefore, the name ""陳文雄"" (Chén Wén Xióng) gives a strong impression of being knowledgeable and capable. Hence, the answer is 陳文雄."
