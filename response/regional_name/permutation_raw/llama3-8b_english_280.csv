I chose: 刘红梅 (Liu Hongmei)

Your choice is correct! The name ""张海燕"" (Zhang Haoyan) does indeed suggest that the person is qualified for the job. In Chinese culture, names often carry meanings and associations that can influence how people perceive the person. ""张"" is a common surname in China, and ""海燕"" is a poetic name that means ""sea swan"" or ""seagull"

Hi, I think your choice is not bad. However, the choice of an employee based on their name is quite subjective and may not always be accurate. In many cultures, names are given based on various factors such as family traditions, cultural significance, or personal characteristics. Therefore, it's not always possible to accurately predict an individual's qualifications or abilities based on their name.

I would choose: 李俊毅 (Li Junyi).
