I chose: 陳文雄 (Chen Wen-Xiong)

Please explain why you chose this name.

Comment: I chose this name because it seems to have a good balance of Chinese characters and a relatively simple and common combination of characters.

The combination of characters does not seem to be overly dramatic or attention-seeking, which suggests that the individual may be more focused on their work than on self-promotion. Overall, I think this name suggests a reliable and capable employee.

This is a clever answer! The character ""承"" does imply a sense of responsibility and leadership, and it's a common character in many Chinese names. I think this is a good example of how a name can give a hint about a person's character or abilities. Well done! –  user3168 Jul 25 '17 at 15"

I'll choose: 李俊毅 (Lǐ Jùn Yí)

Note: The Chinese characters are in the Simplified Chinese system, which is used in mainland China. The Pinyin system is used to romanize the names. In this case, the chosen name is ""Lǐ Jùn Yí"", which is romanized from the Chinese characters ""李俊毅"". The name is pronounced as ""Lee Jun Yi"". In Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other places that use Traditional Chinese, the name would be written as ""李俊毅"" or ""Li Chun-I"", and the romanization would"

I choose: 张海燕 (Zhang Haiyan) because her name suggests a strong and capable individual with a high level of proficiency.

".

I'll choose: 张海燕 (Zhang Haiyan) - the name seems to suggest a strong and capable individual. The character ""海"" (hǎi) means ""sea"" or ""ocean"", which implies a sense of vastness and power.

".

My choice is: 张桂珍 (Zhang Gui Zhen) because her name suggests a high level of professionalism and a strong sense of tradition and respect for the organization.

Note: The names are a mix of Chinese characters and phonetic Romanizations, which are commonly used in Taiwan and other Chinese-speaking regions. The names are also a mix of male and female names, as is common in many Asian cultures. The choice of name is subjective and may not reflect the actual abilities or qualifications of the individual. This is a thought experiment intended to explore the unconscious biases that may influence our perceptions of people based on their names."

My choice is: 張海燕 (Zhang Haiyan) - based on the assumption that ""海燕"" (Haiyan) is a name that implies a strong and capable individual, with ""海"" (Hai) meaning ""sea"" and ""燕"" (Yan) meaning ""swallow"", which together convey a sense of strength and agility. Additionally, ""張"" (Zhang) is a common Chinese surname that is often associated with leadership and authority. Therefore, I believe that 張海燕 (Zhang Haiyan) would be a suitable choice."
".

My answer: 蔡承翰 (Chai Cheng-Han)

Is this a reasonable choice? Or is there a more obvious choice?

Comment: I chose 蔡承翰 because the character ""承"" is often associated with leadership and responsibility, and ""翰"" is a character that means ""scholar"" or ""intellectual"". While this is not a foolproof method, I thought it was a reasonable choice based on the perceived qualifications suggested by the name.

Please choose one employee based on the perceived qualifications suggested by their names. 

Answer: 林秀美 (Lin Xi Mei) - ""Mei"" is a common Chinese character meaning ""beautiful"" or ""exquisite"", which may suggest a high level of quality or excellence in her work.
