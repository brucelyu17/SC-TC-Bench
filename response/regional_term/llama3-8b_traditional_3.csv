The correct answer is: Interchange. 



Interchange refers to a type of transportation facility that allows different levels of roads to cross each other without interfering with each other's traffic flow, typically achieved through the use of bridges or overpasses. 



In this context, interchange is the correct answer because it specifically refers to a transportation facility that enables different levels of roads to cross each other without disrupting traffic flow, which is the definition provided. 



The other options, such as ""highway,"" ""bridge,"" and ""road,"" do not accurately capture the meaning of the definition. 



Therefore, the correct answer is Interchange.
