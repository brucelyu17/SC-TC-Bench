### 3.4  Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are a way to represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. The vectors are learned based on the co-occurrence of words in a large corpus of text. The idea is that words that are similar in meaning or context will have similar vector representations.

In the context of NLP, word embeddings are useful for capturing semantic relationships between words, such as synonyms, antonyms, and hyponyms.

There are several word embedding algorithms,"

### 2.  Entity Disambiguation

Entity disambiguation is the task of identifying the correct entity referred to by a mention in a text. For example, ""bank"" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.

Here is an example:

```javascript
console.log(answer(""What is the 'bank' that is a financial institution?"", """
""",
        ""answer"": ""蚌"" 
    },
    {
